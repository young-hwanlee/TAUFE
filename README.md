# TAUFE

## Task-Agnostic Undesirable Feature DeactivationUsing Out-of-Distribution Data, NeurIPS, 2021

**TAUFE** is a general and powerful regularizer for autoencoder (AE)-based embedding methods on the graph data where the data follow the power-law distribution w.r.t the sparsity of input vectors. **TRAP** significantly boosts performances of two represensitive graph embedding tasks, *(1) Top-k recommendation* on user-item transaction datasets and *(2) Node classification* on common graph datasets, by up to *31.53%* and *94.99%* respectively. 

# Requirements
